        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <em>Cook the pasta:</em>
            Fill a large, heavy pot with water and add enough salt that it tastes like the sea (2 tablespoons or so). Bring to a boil. 
            
            Add the spaghetti and cook until just shy of al dente. You want it ever-so-slightly undercooked. Scoop 1 cup of pasta water out of the pot before draining the spaghetti into a colander.<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> <em>Make the sauce:</em>
                Return the pot to the stove and set over medium heat. Add the olive oil and allow it to heat up enough that it sizzles gently when you add a sliver of garlic. 
                
                Add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Sauté, stirring constantly, until the garlic turns slightly golden (but don’t let it brown), about 2 minutes.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> <em>Toss the pasta:</em>
                Add the reserved 1 cup of pasta cooking water to the pot and adjust the heat so that the liquid simmers. Add the pasta and cook, stirring regularly with tongs. You want the heat high enough that you hear the sizzle of the liquid. 
                
                After a few minutes, when the pasta has absorbed nearly all of the liquid, remove the pot from heat. Add 1 teaspoon salt and the Parmesan and stir well. Taste and add more salt, if needed. 
                
                Transfer to a serving bowl (or serve in the cooking pot) and scatter the parsley over the top, if using. 
                
                Serve immediately with more Parmesan to pass at the table.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <em>Heat the pasta water:</em>
            Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.)<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> <em>Sauté the fillet:</em>
            While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the fillet and cook slowly until it became goldish.

            Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> <em>Beat the eggs and half of the cheese:</em>
            In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.<br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> <em>Cook the pasta:</em>
            Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.<br>
            <strong>Step 5:</strong> <em>Toss the pasta with fillet</em>
            When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with the fillet and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.

Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.

Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That's the tricky part.)<br>
            <strong>Step 6:</strong> <em>Add the beaten egg mixture:</em>
            Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out.<br>
